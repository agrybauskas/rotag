++ Add new PDBxParser::filter option so, it could return also the order of
   selection.
-- Combined residue id, chain and PDB model num could be unique identifier for
   _[local]_ cif, because residue ids are not unique by themselves.
-- Decide how to handle dihedral angle calculations on residues without
   rotatable bonds.
++ Make rotamers show properly in Jmol by assigning label_alt_id different
   labels.
-- Maybe rotag-select could filter also by residue or atom ids, because when
   parsing files and using pipes some of the [local] data might be lost or not
   needed.
++ Order maybe should be changed to group only.
