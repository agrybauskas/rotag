++ Add new PDBxParser::filter option so, it could return also the order of
   selection.
++ Combined residue id, chain and PDB model num could be unique identifier for
   _[local]_ cif, because residue ids are not unique by themselves.
++ Decide how to handle dihedral angle calculations on residues without
   rotatable bonds.
++ Make rotamers show properly in Jmol by assigning label_alt_id different
   labels.
-- Maybe rotag-select could filter also by residue or atom ids, because when
   parsing files and using pipes some of the [local] data might be lost or not
   needed.
++ Order maybe should be changed to group only.
++ Should properly track the quantity of significant digits.
-- Should use lambda function instead of eval in LinearAlgebra.pm.
!! Write two functions determining configuration hierarchy: R or S (for sp3) and
   cis (Z) or trans (E) (for sp2).
-- Should have basic and most necessary attributes for PDBx and transfer them.
   However, should have option to carry everything through pipes.
++ Because sidechains grow when calculating energy, there might be no information
   about transformed next atom. One of the solutions might be to have one more
   rule - calculate when H is present. Another one - make second step
   calculations they might be also necessary for intramolecular clashes.
++ around_distance(), connect_atoms(), generate_library() and rotag_energy have
   very similar interation through cells. It should be refactored and the
   redundant code also should be removed.
-- Create functions that generate rotamer_energy and rotamer_angle cif loops.
++ rotag_energy should have pairwise and rotamer/residue flags.
++ Partial charges and full charges probably should be described for each
   residue.
++ pi and the constants that are being generated during the calculations should
   be generated during the build. This way calculation will only occur once.
-- Make proline also rotatable, but by adding a point (atom) that the last
   side-chain atom shoul be connected to would also produce rotamers.
-- There should be a check of must attributes in CIF.
++ Add option to use only implicit hydrogen bond model for composite energy
   potential.
-- Add 0 value energy to rotag_energy.
++ Parameter control should be added to rotag_energy for debugging.
-- Should decide, how to change alt id for original atom after pseudo atom is
   generated. Should it be kept to '.'? Or changed to match pattern in CIF?
++ Add additional sp2 hybridization test where it checks if the atoms are in
   one plane.
++ Basic connectivity for 20 amino acids should be checked by looking at table
   or Perl data structure.
++ Add pre-defined hybridizations for 20 amino acids.
-- Make sort by attribute in filter().
++ Have to deal with defaults of force fields. Might be good to store them into
   one file.
++ Add capability to turn not only by angle, but also by ratio in rotag_library.
-- Check if vector lengths when adding hydrogens all are 1.0.
-- Add debug checks on the absence of connection, conformation, hybridization
   and certain parameters for interaction functions.
-- Generalize atom_site data structure, because it can be used even with other
   types of data.
++ Add option to mutate with given dihedral angle.
-- 'label_alt_id' probably should be used only when main-chain has one.
++ Optimize AtomSite::filter().
++ Analyze only heavy atoms.
++ Add mainchain angle calculations for rotag_dihedral script.
++ random-seed option is not working properly in rotag_select.
-- Maybe should have an ability to sort PDBx entries according to residues,
   because Jmol has a bug of viewing atoms with alternative ids.
-- Maybe should add capability to select residues according to their main-chain
   and side-chain dihedral angles.
-- around_distance() and grid_box() functions should isolated different alt-ids.
-- Figure out how heteroatoms should be treated when the part of them are
   selected and included in iteraction sites.
++ Add group assignment keyword to the grammar.
