++ Add new PDBxParser::filter option so, it could return also the order of
   selection.
++ Combined residue id, chain and PDB model num could be unique identifier for
   _[local]_ cif, because residue ids are not unique by themselves.
-- Decide how to handle dihedral angle calculations on residues without
   rotatable bonds.
++ Make rotamers show properly in Jmol by assigning label_alt_id different
   labels.
-- Maybe rotag-select could filter also by residue or atom ids, because when
   parsing files and using pipes some of the [local] data might be lost or not
   needed.
++ Order maybe should be changed to group only.
-- Should properly track the quantity of significant digits.
-- Should use lambda function instead of eval in LinearAlgebra.pm.
!! Write two functions determining configuration hierarchy: R or S (for sp3) and
   cis (Z) or trans (E) (for sp2).
-- Should have basic and most necessary attributes for PDBx and transfer them.
   However, should have option to carry everything through pipes.
++ Because sidechains grow when calculating energy, there might be no information
   about transformed next atom. One of the solutions might be to have one more
   rule - calculate when H is present. Another one - make second step
   calculations they might be also necessary for intramolecular clashes.
++ around_distance(), connect_atoms(), generate_library() and rotag_energy have
   very similar interation through cells. It should be refactored and the
   redundant code also should be removed.
-- Create functions that generate rotamer_energy and rotamer_angle cif loops.
++ rotag_energy should have pairwise and rotamer/residue flags.
-- Partial charges and full charges probably should be described for each
   residue.
-- pi and the constants that are being generated during the calculations should
   be generated during the build. This way calculation will only occur once.
