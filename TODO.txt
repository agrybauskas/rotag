++ Add new PDBxParser::filter option so, it could return also the order of
   selection.
-- Combined residue id, chain and PDB model num could be unique identifier for
   _[local]_ cif, because residue ids are not unique by themselves.
-- Decide how to handle dihedral angle calculations on residues without
   rotatable bonds.
-- Make rotamers show properly in Jmol by assigning label_alt_id different
   labels.
