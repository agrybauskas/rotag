    add pseudo atoms.
 
Usage:
    rotag_add -S input.cif > output.cif
    rotag_add -H input.cif > output.cif
 
Options:
    -S, --side-chains     add atoms of defined rotamer. Input .cif has to
                          contain _[local]_rotamer_angle category (can be
                          produced with rotag_library).
 
    -H, --hydrogens       add hydrogen atoms to selected atoms.
 
    -s, --selected        include selected atoms.
 
    --tags          select PDBx category that will be in the output.
 
    -k, --keep-original   keep original atoms after new atoms are added
                          (applicable for -S option).
 
    -c, --clear-positions add only those hydrogens that have clear positions
                          from the current structure (applicable for -H option).
 
    -v, --version         print version.
